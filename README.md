# HAL_hackathon

Do you like old space movies?
Do you like sentient AI that may or may not try to kill your whole crew?
Well, look no further than the HAL desktop buddy! State of the art voice recognition and speech capability,
here are some special phrases:

Start Conversation:
"Open the pod bay doors HAL": This will start the chat with HAL, and now you can say whatever you want and HAL will respond!

End Conversation
"HAL, I won't argue with you anymore": Ends the chat and exits the program

Song:
Want to be terrified? Ask HAL "sing me a song" at any point
